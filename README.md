## Setup

## Description
### Forkfile
- The objective of this project is to work with files and input/output functions. In addition to that, working with process control, specifically using fork to create a parent and child processes that can execute a command and check how the child process exited after executing the command. This project uses concepts of pointers and structures to make datastructures which makes the code work the way it should. This project will work with reading in a file and extracting and organizing information into these datastructures and accessed through various functions.
